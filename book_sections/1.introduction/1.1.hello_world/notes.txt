/*

- Definition of a function named main() with no parameters and that returns nothing.
- The main function is the first code that runs in every executable Rust program.
- Parameters go inside the ().
- Itâ€™s good style to place the opening curly bracket on the same line as the function declaration, adding one space in between
    -> Note: If you want to stick to a standard style across Rust projects, you can use an automatic formatter tool called rustfmt to format your code in a particular style (more on rustfmt in Appendix D of the Rust book).

- Rust style is to indent with four spaces, not a tab
- println! calls a Rust macro. What have to be understood for now is that using '!' calls a macro instead of a normal function. Macros not always follows the same rules as normal functions.
- ';' needs to be used in the end of a command.

- To compile a Rust program you need to write the command 'rustc' plus the name of the code file. For exemple: rustc main.rs.
- It results in a binary executable.
- Rust is an ahead-of-time compiled language, meaning that you can compile a program and give the executable to someone else, and they can run it even without having Rust installed.
